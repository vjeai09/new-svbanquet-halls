# How to Choose the Right Banquet Hall — A Short Story

_Every event has tiny moments that become memories. This guide follows a planner through the small, practical choices that make an event feel effortless. Short Telugu summaries appear under each heading._

## 1. The guest list that begins it all
_తెలుగు: అతిథుల సంఖ్య నిర్ణయించండి_

Start with two numbers: the conservative RSVP and the generous maximum. These will guide size, seating and budget conversations with every venue.

## 2. Visit like a guest
_తెలుగు: వేదికను అతిథి దృష్టితో పరిశీలించండి_

Walk the layout, check acoustics, and follow the vendor route from loading bay to stage. Photos don't tell these stories — visits do.

## 3. Ask practical questions
_తెలుగు: నిజమైన ప్రశ్నలు అడగండి_

Ask about vendor load-in windows, decor limits, curfew and overtime charges. Practical schedules reveal constraints the sales pitch hides.

## 4. Read the quote closely
_తెలుగు: ఖర్చులను జాగ్రత్తగా బట్టి చూడండి_

Look for surcharges: electricity, service fees, cleaning, VAT/GST and overtime. Request an itemized quote and confirm cancellation policies.

## 5. Map the day
_తెలుగు: రోజు-రోజును మ్యాప్ చేయండి_

Create a simple vendor map (loading → kitchen → stage) and a single point of contact. Clear logistics prevent most day-of problems.

## 6. Choose calm over flash
_తెలుగు: ప్రశాంతతకి ప్రాధాన్యం ఇవ్వండి_

Staff who answer clearly and solve small problems are often worth more than a flashier space. Pick the hall that makes planning feel easier.
